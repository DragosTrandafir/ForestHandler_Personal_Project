# ForestHandler
Manipulates a forest repository through differents commands accessible to the user

PROBLEM SPECIFICATION
A national park service manages a databases and needs a program to visualise and handle all the trees in the park,
together with some specific elements of each of them.
The program manages several trees and allows different operations.

Objectives 
Development of Python modules to solve complex problems
• Develop Python modules and classes
• Use test-driven development 
• Learn how to work with exceptions
• Familiarize with special libraries e.g. numpy, matplotlib

Requirements
1. Implementing a solution for the problems using classes and feature driven 
development
2. The solution offers a console type interface that allows the user to input 
the data and visualize the output (in the console and visually with matplotlib)
3. The program uses only the standard and compound data types available in Python
The application is developed along several iterations and the solution
ensures:
• Validation of data – when the user introduces invalid commands or data, a 
warning should be generated

Additional information
- all the data is created in the main module
- main.py should be run in order to start the application
